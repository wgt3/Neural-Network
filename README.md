# Neural-Network
For this project I created a neural network based on Chapter 11 of "Elements of Statistical Learning" (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman, 2008). The purposes of the project were to both gain a deeper understanding of neural nets and to demonstrate the ability to turn math into code.
# Description
This network uses one hidden layer with an adjustable number of hidden units as well as adjustable learning rate and weight decay. The network was used for regression, so there is only one class and the network outputs values, rather than probabilities as would be the case for a classification problem. A penalty is added to the error function to limit the size of weights. Back-propagation is used to find optimal weights.
